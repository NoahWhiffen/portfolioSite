            <p>
                I grew up in a small outport community in Newfoundland. I spent 10 years working retail as a meat clerk/ butcher,
                which is still what I do currently. I always knew it wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life so I started
                to browse online for different ideas and eventually discovered coding. This quickly developed in to a passion, but 
                I needed a more structured learning environment, as self taught was sort of working, sort of not. I applied to Keyin
                College and the TechNL scholarship and was graciously accepted! Now I am on the path to finding my purpose in life.

                This website needs a lot of work before it is eventually deployed on line, and I ran out of time to finish it,
                but I hope you enjoy it all the same!
