                            This is the first project I ever created when I started 
                            learning to code 2 years ago. It calculates your net pay based
                            on your hours worked and your hourly rate of pay. The GUI is generated
                            by Tkinter.

                            This is the second project I ever created in Python, 
                            before I started the Software Developer program at Keyin College.
                            It compares your inputed password with a list of 10,000 of the 
                            most common passwords.

                            This was part of our final sprint from semester 1 that myself and two of my colleagues 
                            worked on. It is a program to keep track of records for an imaginary cab company. The 
                            menu runs in the terminal, as opposed to Tkinter like the two above.

                            This is a website I made for my third assignment of the first semester. It is a family
                            tree website that I intend to use for my family tree project in the future. It is a simple
                            website, only using HTML and CSS, but it is one of my favourites.

                            This is a React application I created during my second semester. It pulls from an API
                            on the internet and allows you to select a dog breed, and the number of images you would
                            like generated of that breed.

                            This is also a React application I created during my second semester. It allows you to
                            record upcoming events and store them within the browser as JSON. You can delete them and
                            add as many as you like.
